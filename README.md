 abt me
</summary>

hey, i'm cobalt, or flo. i'm not quite talkative, but i'm an easy-going, friendly person.

20 yrs old ﹒ 12.07 ♐

don't associate my friends w/me. i don't agree w/everything they do/say

if i'm bothering you, pls tell me

i believe my ocs are alive, feel their own things, have their own interests, etc.

i have a bad memory and might need refreshers sometimes

i'm easier to speak to in whispers as i'm mostly off-tab
