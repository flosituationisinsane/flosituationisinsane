  before you interact
</summary>

don't associate me w/my friends. i don't agree w/everything they do/say.

i believe my ocs are alive in my mind, i believe they feel their own things, have their own interests, etc. certain ocs don't like getting touched w/o permission.

i block/hide freely

i can be blunt if someone/something's bothering me, and am not afraid to say if i dislike something.

if i'm bothering you, pls tell me. i'd rather know and attempt to sort things out.

i have a bad memory and might need refreshers sometimes

i'm easier to speak to in whispers as i'm mostly off-tab
