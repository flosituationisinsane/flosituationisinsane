hey & welcome. i'm an easy-going, friendly person.

don't associate me w/my friends pls. i don't agree w/everything they do/say.

don't color-drop, copy, or take insp from my ponies.

i can be blunt if something's bothering me. i'm also bad at explaining & have a bad memory, i might need refreshers sometimes

i believe my ocs are alive, feel their own things, have their own interests, etc.

idm if you cuddle or hide behind me, but pls don't boop repetitively or cover me intentionally (i don't have a td/tt, however, it bothers me)

i'm easier to speak to in whispers as i'm off-tab usually
